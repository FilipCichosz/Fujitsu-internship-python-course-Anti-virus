# Fujitsu Internship Python Course: Anti-virus

This project is developed as part of the Fujitsu internship Python course. The program checks all files in a directory using a robust antivirus API from the internet, and then segregates or deletes the files based on the scan results.

## Features

- Scans all files in a specified directory using a powerful antivirus API.
- Segregates files into specific directories based on the scan results (e.g., Clean, Infected).
- Deletes infected files if specified.

## Algorithm Explanation

1. **Directory Scan**: The program scans all files within a specified directory.
2. **Antivirus Check**: Each file is sent to a strong antivirus API for scanning.
3. **File Segregation**: Based on the scan results, files are moved to designated directories (e.g., Clean, Infected).
4. **Optional Deletion**: Infected files can be deleted if the option is enabled.
